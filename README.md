# Tic-Tac-Toe
My first "big" project! I'm still relatively new to programming, so this was a huge accomplishment for me :D
It's just your regular ol' text-based tic-tac-toe. You can either choose PvC (player v computer) or PvP (player v player), and I gave the computer an "AI," if you can call it that, so it'll play as a human would.
